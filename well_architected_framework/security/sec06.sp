For example, Amazon RDS helps you set up, operate, and scale a relational database, automates administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. This means you have more free time to focus on securing your application in other ways described in the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, so you only need to focus on the connectivity, invocation, and security at the code levelâ€“not the infrastructure or operating system."

For example, use a change management workflow to deploy Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances using infrastructure-as-code, then manage Amazon EC2 instances using tools such as AWS Systems Manager instead of allowing direct access or through a bastion host. AWS Systems Manager can automate a variety of maintenance and deployment tasks, using features including automation workflows, documents (playbooks), and the run command.

For example, you should verify the code signing certificate of binaries and scripts to confirm the author, and ensure it has not been tampered with since created by the author. AWS Signer can help ensure the trust and integrity of your code by centrally managing the code- signing lifecycle, including signing certification and public and private keys. You can learn how to use advanced patterns and best practices for code signing with AWS Lambda. Additionally, a checksum of software that you download, compared to that of the checksum from the provider, can help ensure it has not been tampered with."
