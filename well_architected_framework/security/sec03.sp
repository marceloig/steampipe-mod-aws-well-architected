Use group and identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining permissions for individual users. Users should only have the permissions required to do their job. Users should only be given access to production environments to perform a specific task within a limited time period, and access should be revoked once that task is complete. Permissions should be revoked when no longer needed, including when a user moves onto a different project or job function. Administrator privileges should be given only to a small group of trusted administrators. Permissions should be reviewed regularly to avoid permission creep. Machine or system accounts should be given the smallest set of permissions needed to complete their tasks."
