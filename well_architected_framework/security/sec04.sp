Consider centralizing logs for better operational results."

Regular reviews will help you tune automation tools, and continuously iterate. In AWS, investigating events of interest and information on potentially unexpected changes into an automated workflow can be achieved using Amazon EventBridge. This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions), or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis."
