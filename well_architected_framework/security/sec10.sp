When you define your approach to incident response in the cloud, in unison with other teams (such as your legal counsel, leadership, business stakeholders, AWS Support Services, and others), you must identify key personnel, stakeholders, and relevant contacts. To reduce dependency and decrease response time, make sure that your team, specialist security teams, and responders are educated about the services that you use and have opportunities to practice hands-on."
