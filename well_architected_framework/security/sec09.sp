  description = "Store encryption keys and certificates securely and rotate them at appropriate time intervals with strict access control. The best way to accomplish this is to use a managed service, such as AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). It lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the internet as well as resources on private networks. ACM integrates with AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), AWS distributions, and APIs on API Gateway, also handling automatic certificate renewals. If you use ACM to deploy a private root CA, both certificates and private keys can be provided by it for use in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, containers, and so on."

Only use protocols with encryption when transmitting sensitive data outside of your virtual private cloud (VPC). Encryption helps maintain data confidentiality even when the data transits untrusted networks. All data should be encrypted in transit using secure TLS protocols and cipher suites. Network traffic between your resources and the internet must be encrypted to mitigate unauthorized access to the data. Network traffic solely within your internal AWS environment should be encrypted using TLS wherever possible."
